# Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems :
gentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit characteristics of agency, meaning they appear capable of autonomous action, decision-making, and goal-oriented behavior. The term "agentic" is derived from "agency," which implies the ability to act independently and make choices.

In AI, agentic systems are often designed to:

Autonomy: Operate without constant human intervention, making decisions based on their programming and the data they receive.
Goal-Orientation: Pursue specific objectives, such as optimizing a process, completing a task, or achieving a desired outcome.
Adaptability: Learn from new data and adjust their behavior to better achieve their goals.
Interactive Capability: Communicate or collaborate with humans or other systems effectively, sometimes appearing proactive in their interactions.
Agentic AI is commonly seen in applications like:

Virtual Assistants: Such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, which can perform tasks autonomously based on user commands.
Autonomous Systems: Including self-driving cars and robotic process automation (RPA) tools.
Smart Agents in Games: Non-playable characters (NPCs) or entities that react and adapt to players' actions.
AI Decision Systems: For business, healthcare, or logistics, where AI makes complex decisions based on data analysis.
The idea of Agentic AI also raises ethical considerations, as systems with perceived autonomy may lead to questions about accountability, transparency, and the extent of control humans retain over these intelligent agents.
